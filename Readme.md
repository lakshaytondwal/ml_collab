#Loan Prediction Model 🏦💰

This project builds a Loan Prediction Model using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The model predicts whether a loan will be approved based on factors such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, property area, and gender.

📌 Features
✔️ Preprocesses dataset (handles missing values and encodes categorical data)
✔️ Trains multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN)
✔️ Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
✔️ Visualizes performance metrics using bar charts


#Model Training & Evaluation

We train three models:
🔹 Logistic Regression
🔹 Random Forest Classifier
🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

After training, the models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are displayed in a bar chart.
